        Your walking your habitual walk, when you walk upon a building which lays where your walk used to be.
        While any normal person would walk around, your stubornly dedicated to habit, and thus attempt to walk
        your habitual walking route... through the house. As you enter, you notice that the door you came from 
        has dissapeared, and seemingly moved infront of you. Desperately trying to maintain habit, you begin 
        looking for a way out. The sign above the door tells you that you need to find and unlock a gold and 
        silver lock to escape.
        
        NEW OBJECTIVE: 
        Unlock the door by finding and unlocking the Silver and Gold lock.
